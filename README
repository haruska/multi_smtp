MultiSmtp
=========

A simple improvement to ActionMailer that allows the sending of email from multiple accounts across the same domain. For example, it can
be used to get around the sent message limit imposed by gmail when using apps for your domain.


Example
=======

Adjust your smtp settings in environment.rb to have an array of user names to authenticate against the smtp server.

Rails::Initializer.run do |config|

... snip ...

  config.after_initialize do
    # For sending mail through gmail
    ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = {
      :address => "smtp.gmail.com",
      :port => 587,
      :domain => "localhost.localdomain",
      :authentication => :plain,
      :user_name => (1..15).collect {|n| "robot#{n}@mydomain.com"},
      :password => "shhhh-common-password"
    }
    
...snip...

end
